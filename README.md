  - ~~Sonarr: series tracker~~ âœ…
  - ~~Radarr: movies tracker~~ âœ…
  - ~~Jackett: torrent client api~~ âœ…

  - Bazarr: subtitles tracker ðŸš§
  - Rclone: remote/cloud file management ðŸš§ (maybe)

## Setting up ansible

``` sh
pip install ansible
```
(or use homebrew: `brew install ansible`)

## Set up the server list to play on

Check inventory after setting up the [ansible hosts file](./ansible_hosts.conf) in the expected location `/etc/ansible/hosts` .

(Below it's being symlinked to the file in this repo but you can also just paste the contents there directly.)
``` sh
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
sudo ln -s ~/Repos/Notes/duvplex/ansible_hosts.conf /etc/ansible/hosts
ansible-inventory --list -y

# or specify inventory
ansible-inventory -i ansible_hosts.conf --list -y
```

## Test connection

Add public key to the server as root and then test out connection.
Also copy that public key to this folder for the playbook to use when it runs.

Tries to ssh as root in this case
``` sh
ansible all -m ping -u root
```

## Vault to store passwords

file:ansible_vault_password.txt --> vault password
file:ansible_vault.yml --> Put passwords here

``` sh
cd ~/Repos/duvplex/
ansible-vault create ansible_vault.yml
ansible-vault decrypt --vault-password-file=ansible_vault_password.txt ansible_vault.yml
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file=ansible_vault_password.txt ansible_vault.yml
```

## Set VPN password in ansible vault

Set your passwords in a file named `ansible_vault.yml`:

``` yml
password: your_suepr_secure_server_password
OPENVPN_USERNAME: sdsdsijsldijij
OPENVPN_PASSWORD: sdopksdpjsdpsijpass
PASSWORD_7Z: password used when backing up config files
```

## Execute the playbook

``` sh
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i ansible_hosts.conf --vault-pass-file ansible_vault_password.txt
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i ansible_hosts.conf --vault-pass-file ansible_vault_password.txt --tags backup
```

## Bring the docker containers up manually now that server is setup

Create everything
``` sh
cd ~/plex
# likely problematic so run it alone to fix it if need be because this container also holds the VPN info
docker-compose up transmission

docker-compose up # run all the services we just set up

# run as background deamon
docker-compose up -d
```

## Web config

You might want to setup your remote IP in your [`/etc/hosts`](/etc/hosts) file (e.g. `165.89.88.177 duvcloud`) to save having to remember a random IP address.

- Transmission      ==> http://duvcloud:9091
- Jackett           ==> http://duvcloud:9117
- Radarr            ==> http://duvcloud:7878
- Sonarr            ==> http://duvcloud:8989
- Plex(After setup) ==> http://duvcloud:32400/web

Plex ssh tunneling, ssh like this first then the URL below will start to work, once we login in and setup stuff the normal URL above will work
``` sh
ssh -L32400:localhost:32400 jonnyparris@duvcloud
```

- Plex         ==> http://localhost:32400/web

## Setup dropbox uploader to backup config

Run
``` sh
~/plex/dropbox_uploader.sh
```

## Notes

- See more detailed write up of setup steps [here](assets/DetailedWriteUp.md)
- Change entire season audio track easily: https://www.pastatool.com/ (Make sure to turn off VPN before connecting to it)
- You can find your timezone [here](https://www.gokuldeepak.com/output-for-timedatectl-list-timezones/) to customise the `TZ` var in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
